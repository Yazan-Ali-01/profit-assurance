# Demo Project
This project is a demo showcasing a static React application. It utilizes Material UI for component styling, Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS, and React with JavaScript for building the user interface. The application is built using Vite, a fast build tool and development server, and is hosted on Netlify for free hosting.

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material UI: A popular React UI framework for implementing Google's Material Design.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
Vite: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
Netlify: A cloud platform for hosting web applications.
## Purpose
This project is intended for demo purposes only. It serves as an example of how to integrate various frontend technologies into a single application. The codebase includes examples of component-based design, responsive layouts, and usage of custom hooks.
